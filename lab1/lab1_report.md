## 3.1 questions

1. LUT: 53200; FF: 106400; Block RAM: 140; DSP Slice: 220

2. A CLB element contains a pair of slices. Each slice is composed of four 6-input Look-Up Table and eight storage elements.

3. Some slices support two additional functions: storing data using distributed RAM and shifting data with 32-bit registers. Slices that support these additional functions are called SLICEM; others are called SLICEL. 

4. Single 6 input or two five-input. 7 series FPGAs are implemented as six-input look-up tables.

5. 7-input: Use two look-up tables and one F7AMUX.

   8-input: Use four look-up tables and F7AMUX, F7BMUX.
